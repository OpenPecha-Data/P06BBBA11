To Fulfil All Wishes
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

lumé kyab kyi nyingpo pemajung
Unfailing heart-essence of refuge, Padmākara,
khyé la nyintsen dü druk mögü kyi
When we pray to you, day and night, at the six times,
dungshuk drakpö solwa deb lak na
With the intense and overwhelming yearning of our devotion,
barché kyen ngen wang du mi tong shying
Let us never be overpowered by obstacles, and evil circumstances,
mindral taktu tukjé kyongwa dang
Guard us with your compassion always, never leave us,
samdön yishyin drubpar jingyi lob
And bless us so all our wishes be fulfilled, just as our minds desire!

So Chökyi Lodrö prayed at the Derab estate in upper Lhalung in Gungru district.
