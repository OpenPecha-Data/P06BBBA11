Inspire me so that all appearances dawn as the guru!

Inspire me to capture the stronghold of pure awareness!

Inspire me to reach the culmination of the four visions!

Inspire me to attain the five spontaneously perfect kāyas!

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this in response to a request from Drolma Lhakar, a ḍākinī of noble family.
Virtue! Virtue! Virtue! May all be auspicious!
